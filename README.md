# Kanban Board

A kanban board is one of the tools that can be used to implement kanban to manage work at a personal or organizational level. Kanban boards visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process.

## Motivation

I wanted to make a simple app to test out React DnD as first step to building more complex projects in the future using their drag and drop functionality

## Tech/framework used

Built with:

- [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- [React DnD](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd)

## Launching the Server

To launch the application, please run the following command from the project root folder:

`npm run build`
`npm start`
